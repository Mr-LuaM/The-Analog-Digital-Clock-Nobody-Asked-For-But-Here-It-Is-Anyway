# The Analog-Digital Clock Nobody Asked For, But Here It Is Anyway

## About

Let’s face it—regular clocks are boring. So here’s a clock that said, “You know what? Let’s make the hands out of numbers instead.” Why? Because we could. This clock is a completely unnecessary blend of analog and digital timekeeping, built for no good reason other than *because it’s funny*.

It tells time. Kind of. And it looks cool... if you squint. 

## Features

- **Numbers as Hands**: Each hand is literally made of numbers. Like, the hour hand is `12 12 12 12` at 12 o'clock. You get the idea.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Yes, it actually works. The hands move in real time.
- **No Frameworks**: Built with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because fancy libraries are for people who care about efficiency.
- **Two-Digit Precision**: All numbers are beautifully padded with a zero because single-digit numbers are just too lonely.

## Why You’ll Love It

- It’s **completely unnecessary**.
- It’s a **conversation starter**. "Hey, why are there numbers spinning around on your screen?"
- It’s a **meme-worthy project**. Show it to your friends, colleagues, or that one HR manager who thinks "What's your favorite programming language?" is a good interview question.

## How It Works

- The **hour hand** is made of repeating numbers like `12 12 12 12` for 12 o'clock.
- The **minute hand** follows the same pattern, but with more numbers because it’s longer. 
- The **second hand**? Oh, that’s the longest one. Watch those numbers fly.
- The clock spins them all around in real time to show the current hour, minute, and second.

## Usage

Here’s how you can proudly run this clock on your machine:

1. Clone this unnecessary masterpiece:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-LuaM/analog-digital-clock.git
